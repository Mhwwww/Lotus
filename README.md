# Lotus: Serverless In-Transit Data Processing for Edge-based Pub/Sub
Lotus adds in-transit data processing to an edge publish-subscribe middleware in order to offload basic message processing from edge devices to brokers. 
It integrates Function-as-a-Service to support efficient multi-tenancy, scale-to-zero, and real-time data processing.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure that tinyFaaS is running, and here is the [tinyFaaS git repository](https://github.com/OpenFogStack/tinyFaaS).

Run the following commands in tinyFaas to start the Management Service and Reverse Proxy.

```bash
make
```

OR

```bash
docker build -t tinyfaas-mgmt ./src/
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8080:8080 --name tinyfaas-mgmt -d tinyfaas-mgmt tinyfaas-mgmt
```

## Getting Started
You could follow these steps to simply get started:

1. Start GeoBroker Server by run the main method of *de.hasenburg.geobroker.server.main.Server.kt*.
2. Start the Rule Manager main method in *de.hasenburg.geover.rulemanager.kt*, and input the subscription and function path.
3. Using the Simple Publishing Client in *de.hasenburg.geobroker.client.main.simplepublishclinet.kt* to publish events to the geobroker server.
4. The matching events will be sent to tinyFaaS and the user-defined function will process the rules for these matching events.


## Introduction
Here are 4 main files: BridgeBuilder, CmdToTinyFaaS, RuleManager, UserSpecifiedRule

### Bridge Builder
The GeoBroker Configuration could be defined here with *GeoBroker host, GeoBroker port, and tinyFaaS base url*. Default configuration is: *GEOBROKER_HOST = "localhost", GEOBROKER_PORT = 5559, TINYFAAS_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:80/"*.
- For every subscription, a Simple Client is created with the unique id in *TinyFaaSClient, functionName, subscription topic, geofence, and the system nanotime*.
- Send connect payload and subscribe payload is sent afterward, if there is/are publish payload received then the matching events would be sent to tinyFaaS in JSON format.

### UserSpecificRule
Give an entry for users to send the subscription and function, and for GeoVER the functions are mainly about rules.

### Rule Manager
Create/Delete rules here, and upload/delete the user function to tinyFaaS.

#### Define Subscription
You need to input the Topic and Location(latitude, longitude, and radius for the circle area) to define the subscription.
Subscription topics should be defined in the format like */a/b/c*, and the lat/lon/radius should be in double.

#### Function operation
To upload the user-defined function to tinyFaaS, the absolute file path is needed. 
To delete the function, the function name is needed. The function name is a topic without slash, for example, if the topic is */berlin/1/test*, then the function name would be *"berlin1test"*.


### CmdToTinyFaas
The cmd commands that needed to send to tinyFaaS are defined in this file and the absolute path of tinyFaaS scripts needs to be defined first.
