# First GeoVer (or Lots or Whatever) Demo

## Setup:

In the file [`CmdToTinyFaaS`](../geover/CmdToTinyFaaS.kt), change line 6 to the location of your tinyfaas.

## For all use cases:

- start tinyfaas
- start GeoBroker
- start the subscriber
- start the publisher

If you press enter twice in the subscriber, it will clean up after itself and destroy the tinyfaas function.
