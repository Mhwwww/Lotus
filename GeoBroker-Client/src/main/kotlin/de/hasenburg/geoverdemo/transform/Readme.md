# Transform Example

Publishers publish their data in json format (because they are not controlled by us or are edge devices that cant do it differently)

Subscribers need this data in csv format (same reasons as above)

So our function transforms the data between formats

We again have one publisher at X locations with one client interested in that location each because that's easier to set up.
